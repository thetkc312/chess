This markdown file was created for the sake of the first assignment. I may eventually use it for something, but honestly, README.md is probably where I'd do it? So this might honestly have no purpose whatsoever. Well, besides learning, for which it was useful. And that's the most important purpose anyway, so this `notes.md` might be the most important file of the semester, as proof that I'm on track to do the project, to learn, and to succeed.
