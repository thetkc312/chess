     * Analyzes the board state to evaluate the set of hypothetical first-degree moves that could be made,

     * can capture, a king in position to perform a castle), but ignoring any obstacles to moves
     * (i.e. would put the piece off the board, would collide with friendly pieces).
     * The Pawn extension of MoveRules is special because of how strongly dependent its moves
     * are on the board state. For example, it can only move forward if there aren't any pieces
     * in front of it at all, so these moves that are possible for other pieces must be manually
     * excluded here, where the set of hypothetically possible moves are generated.
